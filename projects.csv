(Read my short blog about it <a href='https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/star-trek-viz/'>here</a>.) A lot of steps went into creating this viz including scraping the Star Trek transcripts from <a href='https://chakoteya.net'>chakoteya.net</a>, parsing the dialogue data from each episode, transforming the data into jsons readable by D3.js, creating the D3 chart itself, and embedding it all into a webapp.</p>",'stuff,"D3.js; Javascript; HTML; CSS; Python (BeautifulSoup, pandas, Flask)","webapp, https://datascopeanalytics.com/startrekviz/; blog post, https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/star-trek-viz/; github repository, https://github.com/molliemarie/Star_Trek/tree/master/StarTrek; chakoteya.net, http://chakoteya.net/",,2016Wesley Article,Wesley Crushes Ratings article,"<p>While I was creating the Star Trek network webapp, I found myself thinking about a variety of other questions this data would allow me to explore; the first of which centered around a character I've always found abhorrent and annoying - Wesley Crusher - and my desire to quantify the collective dislike of Trekkies everywhere towards this character. The result was the blog post <a href='https://datascopeanalytics.com/blog/wesley-crushes-ratings/'>Wesley Crushes Ratings</a>, where I show that there is a statistically significant inverse correlation between the rating of a particular TNG episode and the amount of lines Wesley Crusher speaks in that episode.

Outlier then hired Datascope to create a visualization to show off some of said survey responses. The <a href='http://outlier.uchicago.edu/evaluation_codeorg/visualizations/codeorg/'>resulting visualization</a> was created using free-form text-response data from three groups of students in response to the question "What is Computer Science?"" This visualization was created for the general public with the hopes of highlighting the size of the study, the individuality of the students, and the uniqueness of the response. </p> ",'stuff,"D3.js, Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS","survey visualization, http://outlier.uchicago.edu/evaluation_codeorg/visualizations/codeorg/",,2016Traffic Stops,ACLU Traffic Stops Project,"<p>I was  connected with the ACLU of Illinois because they were looking for some data scientists to help them explore a traffic stops dataset. This dataset details every instance of someone being pulled over by the police in Illinois and includes details such as their gender, race, violation-type, whether or not they were searched, whether or not anything was found in the case they were searched, etc. ACLU's main goal here is to uncover any racial biases shown in the data and report on it. Some colleagues and I are currently doing exploratory data analysis on the data to uncover and visualize said significant racial biases. The output of this project will lead to a report by the ACLU as well as blog posts on the Datascope blog.</p>",'stuff,"Python (pandas, matplotlib, etc.)",,,Workshop Jetpack,Workshop Jetpack,"<p>This project is a React webapp I am currently working on for internal Datascope purposes. This app will be used during Datascope client workshops and will serve the purpose of 1) allowing the Datascope to link workshop idea sketches and descriptions to a ranking form, 2) allow easy ranking of difficulty and importance of each idea by the workshop attendees, and 3) automatically creating a D3 plot of all the sketches. (Many of these steps are currently being done by hand, so this app would speed up our workshop process!)</p>",'stuff,"D3.js; Javsascript, React, HTML, CSS",,,DS4MAD,Data Science for Managers and Directors Course,"<p>Recently there has been a surge of courses designed to train more data scientists. However, in our experience, managers frequently do not properly use the data talent they already have on their team. In response to this need, we at Datascope are creating the content for a <a href='http://data-science-for-managers.datascope.co/'>Data Science for Managers and Directors course</a>. This course is for anyone who manages data scientists and is interested in distilling their company strategies into concrete projects, understanding which data science tools are best suited for certain tasks, knowing when and how to effectively question data visualizations, and transforming a tangled web of analytical results into a compelling data-driven narrative. I have been involved with creating the content and will also be co-teaching the first few sessions of the course.</p>",'stuff,,"course descriptions, http://data-science-for-managers.datascope.co/",,Data Viz Course,Data Visualization using D3.js Metis Course,"<p>Stuff about Metis class</p>",,,,,Other,Other Relevant Projects,"<p>Some other projects I've been a part of have involved 1) creating a corporate data exploration tool for consumer product companies, 2) working on the development of an internal tool to optimize staffing of projects based on skill-level and availability, and 3) </p>",,,,,
